##  Contribution Policy

We welcome and encourage regular contributions! If you're planning to contribute consistently, here's how to keep things smooth:

- **Frequency**: Weekly or bi-weekly contributions are ideal — consistency over volume.
- **Communication**: Open an issue or discussion before large changes. Avoid surprise PR bombs.
- **Scope**: Focus on improvements, bug fixes, performance tuning, and usability. Avoid feature creep unless it solves a real pain.
- **Quality**: Test your code. If it breaks Neovim, we will find you.
- **Style**: Follow the existing code style. No wild formatting crusades, please.
- **Feedback**: PR reviews are blunt but fair. Don’t take it personally if we roast your code — we roast everyone’s.

If you want to become a regular contributor (or even a maintainer), just show up, make good stuff, and stick around.
